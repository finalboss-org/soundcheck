# WebSocket Implementation

This document describes the basic WebSocket implementation added to the Soundcheck application.

## Overview

A WebSocket connection has been established between the client and server. When a chat completion request is made to `/api/chat/completions`, the server runs bullshit detection on the user's message and broadcasts the full results to all connected WebSocket clients in real-time.

## Architecture

### Server Side

- **WebSocket Server**: Located in `lib/websocket-server.ts`
  - Runs on port 3001
  - Handles client connections and message broadcasting
  - Provides `getWebSocketServer()` and `broadcastToClients()` functions

- **Chat Completions Integration**: Updated `app/api/chat/completions/route.ts`
  - Runs bullshit detection on user messages
  - Broadcasts full bullshit detection results via WebSocket
  - Maintains existing API response functionality

- **WebSocket API**: `app/api/websocket/init/route.ts`
  - GET/POST endpoints to check and initialize WebSocket server
  - Returns server status and connected client count

### Client Side

- **WebSocket Hook**: `hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
  - React hook for managing WebSocket connections
  - Handles connection, reconnection, and message handling
  - Provides connection status and message sending capabilities

- **UI Integration**: Updated `app/page.tsx`
  - Uses WebSocket hook to connect to server
  - Displays WebSocket connection status
  - Shows bullshit detection results in formatted transcription area
  - Includes test button to trigger chat completions

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install ws @types/ws
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the WebSocket**:
   - Open the application in browser
   - Check WebSocket connection status (should show ðŸŸ¢ Connected)
   - Click "Test WebSocket (Trigger Chat Completion)" button
   - The transcription area should show bullshit detection results with:
     - User Message
     - Truth (corrected version)
     - Confidence score
     - Reasoning

## WebSocket Message Format

Messages sent over WebSocket follow this structure:

### Chat Completion Triggered Message
```javascript
{
  type: 'chat_completion_triggered',
  message: 'Bullshit detection complete',
  timestamp: '2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z',
  completionId: 'uuid-string',
  userMessage: 'The original user message that was analyzed',
  bullshitDetection: [
    {
      truth: 'The corrected/truthful version of the statement',
      confidence: 0.85,
      reasoning: 'Detailed explanation of why this was flagged as BS',
      // Additional fields from the bullshit detector may be included
    }
  ]
}
```

### Other Message Types
```javascript
{
  type: 'connected',
  message: 'WebSocket connection established',
  timestamp: '2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z'
}

{
  type: 'echo',
  message: 'Server received: test message',
  timestamp: '2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z'
}
```

## Message Types

- `connected`: Initial connection established
- `chat_completion_triggered`: Sent when chat completion API is called, includes full bullshit detection results
- `echo`: Server echo response (for testing)

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket won't connect**: Ensure the server is running and port 3001 is available
- **Messages not appearing**: Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- **TypeScript errors**: Ensure `@types/ws` is installed

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication for WebSocket connections
- Implement message queuing for offline clients
- Add more message types for different events
- Consider using Socket.IO for additional features
